# 🧠 Coding Challenges & Data Structures Practice

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to solving coding challenges and strengthening core programming skills through practice. It is inspired by the [70+ JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-challenges/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) course and [Codecademy courses](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

## 📌 Purpose


The main goal of this project is to **improve my problem-solving skills and foundational programming knowledge**, with a focus on:

- Practicing JavaScript through hands-on coding challenges
- Revisiting and implementing essential data structures and algorithms
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Expanding solutions over time into **Python** and other languages as I continue learning
